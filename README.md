# Scripting HTTP Requests with NodeJS

## Exercise
Your ultimate objective is to write an HTTPS client that reads and prints HTML from a specified host and path.

This is accompished via a Multi-Step Exercise.

Each Step is designed to use the concepts of the previous Step and expand upon them, adding another concept to the mix.

Please read the entire content of the Step you are working on before you start coding!

- First, create a new directory and init a git repo for this exercise.
- Each Step will have its own file or subdirectory with files (Step 6), so name them accordingly.
- Your life will be easier if you open the entire working directory in Sublime/Atom, since you will be creating several files along the way.
